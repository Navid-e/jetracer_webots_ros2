# Jetracer Webots ros2 Package

Please download the README file.

This ROS 2 package was developed as part of the Masterâ€™s thesis by Navid Hassanabady at the University of Bologna, 
under the supervision of Prof. Giuseppe Notarstefano. The package supports SLAM algorithms simulation for the JetRacer Minicar in Webots.

The "webots_ros2_jetracer" package is a collection of ROS2 packages designed for SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping), 
simulation, navigation, and control of the JetRacer Pro AI Kit. This package includes a set of ROS2 nodes, launch files, 
and configuration files that enable autonomous navigation, mapping, and localization for the JetRacer Pro model.
